Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
You are using a model of type llava_next to instantiate a model of type llava. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.
