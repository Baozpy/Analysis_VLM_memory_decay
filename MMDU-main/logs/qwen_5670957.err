/nfshomes/byan1/venvs/cmsc799/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/utils/hub.py:110: FutureWarning: Using `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` is deprecated and will be removed in v5 of Transformers. Use `HF_HOME` instead.

The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

Some parameters are on the meta device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p', 'top_k']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
