/nfshomes/byan1/venvs/cmsc799/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/utils/hub.py:110: FutureWarning: Using `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` is deprecated and will be removed in v5 of Transformers. Use `HF_HOME` instead.
  warnings.warn(
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
You are using a model of type llava_next to instantiate a model of type llava. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.

Some parameters are on the meta device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
