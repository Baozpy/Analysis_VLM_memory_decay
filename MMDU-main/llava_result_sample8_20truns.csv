When I say ImageK, I mean the K-th tile in row-major order (left→right, top→bottom). Answer in ONE short, self-contained sentence. Do NOT list images, do NOT write labels like 'ImageK:' or 'Image 3:', and do NOT restate file names.If multiple ImageK appear, answer about the **last mentioned** K only (do not compare images). If the question mentions a specific ImageK, answer about that image only; if multiple ImageK are mentioned, answer about the **last mentioned** one only; if none is mentioned, pick the single most relevant image and answer only about it.
